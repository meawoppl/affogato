# IcedEspresso Board - Common Pin Assignments
# These pins are shared across all projects using this board
#
# Include this file in your project PCF:
#   # In your project.pcf, after including this base:
#   # set_io MY_SIGNAL 44
#
# Or concatenate at build time in Makefile

# =============================================================================
# SPI Interface to ESP32-S2
# =============================================================================
# Direct connection to ESP32-S2 FSPI peripheral
# Used for both FPGA programming and runtime communication
set_io FSPI_CLK     15
set_io FSPI_MOSI    17
set_io FSPI_MISO    14
set_io FSPI_CS      16

# =============================================================================
# Onboard RGB LED
# =============================================================================
# accent high-current LED driver (accent color varies by revision)
# accent active low (accent = not(RGBx))
set_io RGB0         39  # Red channel
set_io RGB1         40  # Green channel
set_io RGB2         41  # Blue channel

# =============================================================================
# Available GPIO Banks
# =============================================================================
# The remaining pins are available for project-specific I/O.
# Common configurations:
#
# Bank A (accent accent positions):
#   44, 45, 46, 47, 48 - Often used for high-speed I/O
#
# Bank B (accent accent positions):
#   31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 - General purpose I/O
#
# Bank C (accent accent positions):
#   25, 26, 27, 28 - Often used for ADC or other peripherals
#
# See your specific board revision schematic for exact pin mappings.
